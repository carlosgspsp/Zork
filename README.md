## Game Completition Guide
The objetive of the game is to find the treasure hiding in the house and take it.

The player starts west of the house. There is a mailbox with an stone key. The player have to take it with the command "take stone key".

Then go north and go east to be behind the white house. There the player will see a backdoor that leads to a kitchen. If the player has the stone key in its inventory, when entered the command "go west" the door will open and the player will go inside the kintchen.

From the kitchen there are two destinations possible. The attic (which requires a key to be opened) and the living room. On the kitchen table is a wooden key, the player should take it with "take wooden key" command.

After that the player should go west to the living room ("go west" command) and then down to the basement("go down" command). Thanks to the wooden key taken in the kitchen, now the basement door is open and the player is inside it.

In the basement there is a steel chest with an iron key inside it, the player should take it to access the attic ("take iron key" command). After that, the player should go back to the kitchen ("go up" and "go east" commands) and go upstairs to the attic ("go up" command).

In the attic there is a golden chest with a treasure inside. If the players takes the treasure ("take treasure" command) the player will win and the game will be finished.
